13, Validation not applied to only the Hostname

Note: Regular expression (regex)    (note: \ is to escape - \. and without \ in dot means. -> secure.net = dot anything secureAnet

correct way: ^https:\/\/secure\.pentesterlab\.com\/  -> ^https:\/\/secure\.pentesterlab\.com(?=\/|$) - for subdomain
